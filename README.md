Simplified Primrose 3D Editor
========

An simplified version of the Primrose editor to accompany a SitePoint article on getting started with Primrose.

If you use Primrose for something exciting, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy and I also write all about emerging tech over at [Dev Diner](http://www.devdiner.com) (http://www.devdiner.com)!

Keen for more of this sort of thing? This demo is part of an article at http://www.sitepoint.com.
